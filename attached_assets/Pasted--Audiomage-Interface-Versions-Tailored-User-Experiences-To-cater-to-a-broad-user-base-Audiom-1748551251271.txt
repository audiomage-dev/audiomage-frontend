* **Plugin Integration Prompts:** Clear instructions/links for downloading and using Audiomage's own open-source plugins with DAWs/video editing software.

* **Advanced AI Fine-Tuning:** Granular control over generated audio characteristics that goes beyond simple mood or genre sliders. This includes influencing:

  * **Timbre Control:** Ability to specify the desired "color" or quality of instruments or sound effects (e.g., "make the piano sound brighter and more resonant," "give the explosion a heavier, more sustained rumble").

  * **Rhythmic Density/Complexity:** Control over the intricacy of musical patterns or frequency of sound events (e.g., "generate a sparse, minimalist drum beat," "create a dense, chaotic soundscape with overlapping effects").

  * **Harmonic Richness/Dissonance:** For music generation, influence how "full" or "tense" harmonies are (e.g., "compose a rich, orchestral piece with lush chords," "introduce subtle dissonance to create unease").

  * **Spatialization Nuance:** Ability to control complex spatial movements or room acoustics (e.g., "make footsteps sound like they're walking from an open space into a small, tiled room," "have dialogue echo slightly as if in a large hall").

  * **Dynamic Range Control:** Instruct the AI to generate audio with specific dynamic range (e.g., "generate a track with very little dynamic range for broadcast," "create a highly dynamic soundscape with sharp contrasts").

  * Emotional Arc Mapping: Define an emotional curve for a scene, with the AI generating audio that follows that arc (e.g., "start with calm, build to tension, resolve with relief").  
    These parameters would be exposed through advanced sliders, numerical inputs, and detailed text prompts for precise command.
