## üéØ Objective

Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline for the Audiomage AI-powered audio workstation with comprehensive testing coverage across multiple layers and automated workflows for different branch strategies.

## üìã Requirements

### Testing Layers

#### 1. Unit Tests
- [ ] **Framework Setup**: Configure Jest/Vitest for unit testing
- [ ] **Component Testing**: Test individual React components in isolation
- [ ] **Utility Function Testing**: Test helper functions, audio processing utilities
- [ ] **Hook Testing**: Test custom React hooks (useAudioContext, useTransport, etc.)
- [ ] **Store/State Testing**: Test state management logic
- [ ] **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- [ ] **Mocking Strategy**: Mock external dependencies (Web Audio API, file system)

#### 2. UI Component Tests  
- [ ] **Visual Regression Testing**: Setup Chromatic or Percy for UI consistency
- [ ] **Storybook Integration**: Create stories for major components (ScoreEditor, Timeline, etc.)
- [ ] **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure WCAG compliance using axe-core
- [ ] **Cross-browser Testing**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] **Responsive Testing**: Validate layouts across different screen sizes
- [ ] **Component Integration**: Test component interactions and prop handling

#### 3. End-to-End Tests
- [ ] **Playwright Setup**: Configure E2E testing framework
- [ ] **Critical User Flows**: 
  - Audio file upload and playback
  - MIDI composition and editing
  - Score notation creation and modification
  - Project save/load functionality
  - Multi-track editing workflows
- [ ] **Database Integration**: Test with actual PostgreSQL instance
- [ ] **Audio Processing**: Validate real audio operations
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Measure load times and responsiveness

### GitHub Workflows

#### 1. Master Branch Workflow
- [ ] **Trigger**: Push to `master` branch
- [ ] **Process**:
  - Run full test suite (unit + UI + E2E)
  - Security scanning (npm audit, Snyk)
  - Build production artifacts
  - Deploy to production environment
  - Create GitHub release with changelogs
- [ ] **Requirements**: All tests must pass, security scan clear
- [ ] **Notifications**: Slack/Discord integration for deployment status

#### 2. Release Workflow  
- [ ] **Trigger**: Git tag matching `v*.*.*` pattern
- [ ] **Process**:
  - Validate release candidate
  - Run comprehensive test suite
  - Build and package application
  - Create release notes automatically
  - Deploy to staging for final validation
  - Promote to production after approval
- [ ] **Artifact Management**: Store build artifacts, source maps
- [ ] **Rollback Strategy**: Automated rollback on health check failures

#### 3. Development Workflow
- [ ] **Trigger**: Push to `development` branch
- [ ] **Process**:
  - Run fast test suite (unit tests + essential E2E)
  - Code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
  - Deploy to development environment
  - Run smoke tests on deployed version
- [ ] **Preview Deployments**: Automatic preview links for feature testing
- [ ] **Database Migrations**: Safe migration testing

#### 4. Commit/PR Workflow
- [ ] **Trigger**: Pull request creation/update
- [ ] **Process**:
  - Run unit tests and lint checks
  - Build verification
  - UI component tests
  - Code coverage reporting
  - Automated code review (SonarQube/CodeClimate)
- [ ] **Branch Protection**: Require passing checks before merge
- [ ] **Auto-merge**: Enable for dependabot and minor updates

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Testing Infrastructure
```yaml
Testing Stack:
- Unit Tests: Vitest + Testing Library
